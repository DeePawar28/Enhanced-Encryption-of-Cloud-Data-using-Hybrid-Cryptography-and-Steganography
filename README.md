# Enhanced-Encryption-of-Cloud-Data-using-Hybrid-Cryptography-and-Steganography
This project enhances cloud data security by combining AES and ECC encryption with LSB steganography for secure storage and transmission. It ensures data integrity using SHA-256 hashing and optimizes storage with LZW compression, providing a robust and efficient security framework.
